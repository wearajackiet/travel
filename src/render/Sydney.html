		<h1>Sydney</h1>
		<p>Hi guys! Alina told me you guys were interested in petting kangaroos, stargazing, and potentially a trip to NZ (which I know nothing about except that the area around the airport is gorgeous!). Here's the list of stuff that I did.</p>

		<h2>Logistical Recommendations</h2>

		<h3>Hostel</h3>
		<p>I stayed at <a href="http://www.wakeup.com.au/">Wake Up Sydney</a>, which was a relatively central location. The staff was really nice. It’s right near Haymarket and Central Station (lots of hobos at night, but you’ll be safe). Booked it through <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Wake-Up-Sydney-Central/Sydney/1704?dateFrom=2016-05-11&dateTo=2016-05-14&number_of_guests=2">HostelWorld</a>. Lots of events happening. Downside is WiFi is only free for the first 24 hours. They do have computers for general use (just ask them for the login code). However, if you get cell service, you guys could all split it and tether or something.</p>
		<p>They also offer a <b>free walking tour</b>, which is a great way to get a feel of the city! Highly recommend doing this as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>Would recommend to stay in the <b>CBD / Surry Hills</b> area. Just as north as possible, basically.</p>


		<h3>Packing</h3>
		<p>Bring <b>cash</b>! It’s pretty! I have $10 extra I could give to you.</p>
		<p>If you're staying at a hostel, bring a <b>towel</b>.</p>
		<p>Definitely bring a pair of <b>good walking shoes</b>.</p>
		<p>If you have a <b>$0 foreign transaction fee credit card</b>, that would be great too! Most places in Sydney will take credit card. (If you don’t have one and want one, Jackie could refer you to a Chase Sapphire card! $0 annual fee for first year. After that, you can cancel)</p>
		<p>Jackie has 2 <b>adaptors</b>! You can get more on Amazon!</p>

		<h3>Cell Service</h3>
		<p>Not necessary, but makes everything easier. I got my SIM with <a href="http://www.optus.com.au/shop/mobilephones/SimBYO">Optus</a>. They've got a booth at the airport that you could just drop by and give them money and they'll give you a SIM card.</p>
		<p>Or if you have T-Mobile with roaming, it’ll be slow, but it’ll work.</p>

		<h3>Airport Transportation</h3>
		<p>The <b>Airport Link</b> train (which is part of the Sydney transportation system (which I have a card for remind me to give it to you!)) can take you anywhere there’s a station. It’s a little bit pricy. AU$17 one way.</p>


		<h2>Tourist Recommendations</h2>

		<p>Sydney's neighborhoods can be found on Google Maps. At least, that's the version that I'm referring to. They're probably wrong though.</p>

		<p>FIRSTLY, find a <b>Free Walking Tour</b>. These are a great way to get a taste of the city! If your hostel doesn't offer one, or you plan on staying in an AirBnB, here's a couple I just googled up really quick. I'm sure there's more!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.imfree.com.au/sydney/">I'm Free Sydney</a> has a couple of tour options, including a historical one.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.freetourssydney.com.au/">Free Tours Sydney</a> has a walking tour and a bus tour as well.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Rocks</h3>
		<p>All of the tourist things are here!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-rocks-markets-the-rocks">The Rocks Market</a>. Saturdays and Sundays (10a - 5p), it's a Farmers Market. Fridays (9a - 3p), it's a Foodie Market. Come hungry.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-tea-cosy-sydney">The Tea Cosy</a> for some scones and some afternoon tea.</li>
			<li>Sydney Harbour Bridge</li>
			<ul><li>Pylon looking, 10a - 5p [$11]</li></ul>
			<li>Sydney Observatory</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Day: 10a - 5p [$10 adult, $8 concession]</li>
				<li>Night: 6p - 8:15p, Sat [$22 adult, $20 concession] Mon [$20 adult, $18 concession]</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Barangaroo</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/belles-hot-chicken-sydney">Belle’s Hot Chicken</a>. Best damn chicken wings I’ve ever had. They're not open yet, but their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BellesHotChicken">Facebook page</a> might give you more updates.</li>
			<li>Stargazing at Barangaroo Reserve. Nice park. Slight light pollution though.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>CBD</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/black-star-pastry-sydney">Black Star Pastry</a> for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCJkwo9N--K/">watermelon cake</a> and various other pastries.</li>
			<li>Pie Face for Aussie Pies. This is a chain. You'll probably see it everywhere.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-star-large-fried-chicken-sydney">Hot Star Chicken</a>! Super pricy, but it's the same one as in Taiwan</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/adriano-zumbo-patissier-sydney">Adriano Zumbo Patissier</a> for pastries and macaroons inside the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-queen-victoria-building-sydney">Queen Victoria Building</a></li>
			<li>Hyde Park is beautiful, and there's a church here that's also quite nice.</li>
			<li>Royal Botanical Gardens is super pretty and there's a lot of museums here. There's also a really nice view from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCCQ3YSt-zO/">Mrs. Macquarie's Chair</a>. This is a long walk though! Bring comfy shoes!</li>
			<li>Circular Quay is a ferry terminal. Take this to get to the Taronga Zoo or check out Manly Beach.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Darlinghurst</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/edition-coffee-roasters-darlinghurst">Edition Coffee Roasters</a> is a <b>MUST</b>. It's a Japanese Nordic fusion brunch place and they have teh most beautiful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCFCkzQN-9y/">matcha hotcakes</a>.</li>
			<li>Gelato Messina has the best gelato. There's a few in the area. I'm listing all of them.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Surry Hills</h3>
		<p>This place is brunch central. There's gonna be plenty of spots for good food!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gelato Messina. GELATOOOO.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/catmosphere-cat-cafe-surry-hills">Catmosphere Space Cat Cafe</a> 9/10a - 8p (but get there before 7p)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Manly Beach</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Take a ferry here. It's got really nice views of the city.</li>
			<li>Surfing and beach things. This is a much quieter beach than Bondi.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boathouse-shelly-beach-sydney">The Boathouse</a>. The food looked sooo good. I had a milkshake and it was DELICIOUS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bondi Beach</h3>
		<p>I actually haven't been here, but the beach is somewhat of a tourist central.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gelato Mesina. heh.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Across Harbour Bridge</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Wendy's Secret Garden was an adorable little place with tons of flowers (and a few spiders). It leads to a pier and also Luna Park (which really isn't worth visiting).</li>
			<li>Taronga Zoo. Take a ferry here. Pet kangaroos here.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Farther Away</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.featherdale.com.au/park-information/">Featherdale National Park</a>, I've heard great things about. It's kind of far from the City Center, but the city center is kind of small. If you're planning on staying more than 3 days, you might want to look into coming here rather than going to Taronga. <a href="http://www.featherdale.com.au/directions/">Directions</a> on how to get here.</li>
